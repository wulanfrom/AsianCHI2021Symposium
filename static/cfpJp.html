              <p>The Asian CHI Symposium invites latest contributions from Asian researchers based in Asia and abroad working on HCI research for any technology, domain and regional context. We also welcome contributions from non-Asian researchers focused on incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design and implementation of computing systems. Showcasing works from Asian researchers and those closely related to the Asian culture and society, the symposium promotes the region's unique problems and approaches to the global community. It also intends to foster a network of young researchers like masters students, and more specifically, senior doctoral candidates and those who recently graduated. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have strong interests in HCI).</p>

Only shepherded submissions that successfully go through the shepherding process with approval of the mentor-shepherd within the set deadline will be added to the ACM Digital Library. Submissions that require minor or no revisions will be added to the ACM Digital Library proceedings after the camera-ready deadline and confirmation from the Reviewing chairs.</p>

                <p>Showcase are works that will be presented at other CHI 2020 tracks (as listed <a href="" class="affiliation-link">here</a>). They could be presented at the symposium to broaden the dissemination of high quality published research and to inspire applications, replications, continuation, spin-offs and collaboration. For showcase submissions, <b>authors should submit the pre-print camera-ready version</b> of their accepted submission to CHI 2020 (any track). There is no need to change to the symposium's template.</p>
                <p style="margin: 16px 0">For showcase submissions, their entry in the front matter of the proceedings of the symposium will contain only the title and author names with a pointer to the corresponding entry in the CHI 2020 Proceedings or Extended Abstract Proceedings.</p>
                <p>Both the original and showcase submissions should include key references to publicly accessible resources. Both types of submissions should not be anonymized and must be uploaded through HotCRP.</p>
                <p style="margin: 16px 0 52px 0">Authors may also submit a draft of their poster as supplementary material. They may start following the symposium’s poster guidelines.</p>

Conference attendees will spend 5–10 seconds glancing at each poster from 1–2 meters distance before moving closer to the poster that they are interested in. Another signal that they will look for is the number of people who are currently checking out the poster and talking to the author. </p>

                <p>Therefore, the main job of your poster is to draw the conference attendee in. You should use one prominent image in your poster to achieve this. This main image should either show:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 2em">
                    <li>The uniqueness of your project (e.g., a cool photo of novel hardware or a screenshot that looks different than typical applications).</li>
                    <li>Show the application domain that your project benefits from (e.g., showing the user performing a task).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The rest of the poster should aid your conversation with the audience. Since you will be presenting your poster, verbal information should be communicated to your audience primarily from you. Therefore, the poster should provide visual aid that you will use during this conversation. Such aids may include the following:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 2em">
                    <li>Schematics or diagrams (simplified, if need be)</li>
                    <li>Image showing details of your project</li>
                    <li>Charts showing main results</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since these visual elements will be used when your audience stands closer to the poster, they can be much smaller, <b>readable within 0.5 meter distance</b>. In some projects, you may be able to incorporate some of these elements into the main image such that it can be first attractive and then provide details when look closer.</p>
                <h5 style="margin: 24px 0 8px 0">content</h5>
                <p>While you present the poster, there may be some attendees who came in after you started talking to a few people. Thus, the poster should help people who visit in the middle of your conversation to catch up. This can be achieved by an economical use of text on the following elements:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 2em">
                    <li>Title and subtitle</li>
                    <li>Major talking points (1–3 sentences each): Research question and description of the work (e.g., composition of the artifact or method of study)</li>
                    <li>Results</li>
                    <li>Benefit of your work</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The last purpose of your poster is being a stand-in for your verbal presentation. Therefore, you should never write long paragraphs on your poster. If you are not around your poster, the poster should give enough information to tease the audience to read your work in detail.</p>
                <h5 style="margin: 24px 0 8px 0">pointers</h5>
                <p>You should provide a convenient pointer for the audience to look up your paper. Therefore, you should include the following:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 2em">
                    <li>URL to your project. If your URL is long, use a URL shortening service, e.g., tinyurl.com/short-project-name.</li>
                    <li>A QR code corresponding to the URL.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keep in mind that not everyone will carry a device with QR code reader. Short, human-readable URL should always be present</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 16px">Lastly, put affiliation logos on your poster. The placement of these logos should not compete with important elements of your poster (especially title and URL). Here are some example placements:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 2em">
                    <li>Place the logos at the very top, with an explicit visual boundary (space or color region) from your title. Imagine cutting this region off, your poster title should still be intact. Avoid this style if you have more than two logos because they clutter really quick.</li>
                    <li>Place the logos at the bottom-right corner and project URL at the bottom-left corner. Leave an ample blank space in the middle.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="selection-process">
                <h2>Selection Process</h2>
                <p style="margin: 24px 0 16px 0">Each original submission will go through a juried process and receive two anonymized reviews under the following criteria: originality; significance; and validity. Detailed feedback from reviewers will be given to those who will choose to publish their 4-page articles. Light feedback will be given to authors who will choose the other 2 publication options.</p>
                <p>The submissions under the showcase category will be curated by taking into account the following factors: the number of the accepted original submissions; the geographical diversity of the attendees; and the diversity of research topics. The decision will be sent to the authors without reviews or light feedback.</p>

The eligibility criteria could be checked on the SIGCHI website.
