              <p>The 5th Asian CHI Symposium is the annual symposium organized at CHI conference  to showcase the latest HCI and UX works from Asia and those focusing on incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design and implementation.  This symposium promotes the region's unique problems and approaches to the global community. 
                <div id="separator"></div>
                We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from Asian professional and academic communities in all career stages (e.g., seasoned academics, early career researchers, graduate students, and even undergraduates who have interests in HCI) from Asian communities to be part of this. It also intends to foster a network of young researchers from the Bachelor to Doctoral candidates, recent graduates and postgraduate researchers.

                <p>For the <b> Original Work category</b>, each submission will go through <b>a refereed process</b> and receive two anonymized reviews under the following criteria: Originality; Significance; and Validity. </p>
                <div id="separator"></div>
                <p>The submissions under the <b>Showcase category</b>, each submission will be curated by taking into account the following factors: the number of accepted original submissions; the geographical diversity of the attendees; and the diversity of research topics. The decision will be sent to the authors without reviews or light feedback.</p>
                <div id="separator"></div>
                <p>For the authors whose Original Works are accepted conditionally and require major revisions, <b>we will provide the Shepherding process</b>. Selected mentors will work closely with authors to improve the quality of the manuscript at and after the symposium. Only shepherded submissions that successfully go through the shepherding process with the approval of the shepherd mentor within the set deadline will be added to the ACM Digital Library. Submissions that require minor or no revisions will be added to the ACM Digital Library proceedings after the camera-ready deadline and confirmation from the Reviewing chairs.</p>

                <div id="separator"></div>
                <p>At least <b>one author</b> of each accepted submission must attend the symposium to present their work. Registration deadlines, fees and conditions of acceptance (such as if workshop attendees must register for a day or more of the main conference) will be informed at a later stage, tentatively before March 2021.</p>
                <div id="separator"></div>
                <p>Before the symposium, all accepted submissions must prepare a 5-minute video presentation summarizing their works and submit it to <a href="https://asianchi21.hotcrp.com/">HotCRP</a> at least five days before the event. These will be played during the symposium and followed by a 3-minute live Q&A session. At least one author should join the symposium virtually and answer queries from the attendees. </p>
